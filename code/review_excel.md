#@title: readme.md#@date : 20241206T1348 ALUR#@notes: this is a summary for the take home data exercise for the position of Sr. Data Scientist in People Analytics at Wolt.# Plan1. DONE: Admin: Create project folderFolder=\repo\wolt_people-analytics2. DONE: Admin: Prepare readme.md fileThis file created and updated.3. DONE: download filesExercise files downloaded and saved to folder \repo\wolt_people-analytics\data\00_original\4. TODO: check task description4. DONE: import data (Excel)Two sheets:* Sheet 1, "Employee Roster"* Sheet 2, "Mid-Year Outcomes"Sheets can be merged by key [employee_id]5. OPEN: metadata analysis: Sheet 1, "Employee Roster"* 10035 rows, 7 columns (6 + key). key=[employee_id]# data analysis- [hire_date] -> calc: [hired_days].Does the promotion depend on time?- [job_cat]: I, or T- [job_rank]: 4,5,6,7,8,9 (max)- [job_function]: six positions- [region]: US1, US2, US3, US4Obviously, US divisions, and can be used for geographical visualization.- [gender]: calc -> is_men; men=1; women=0Is there a gender preference?# 6. OPEN: data analysis: sheet 2, "Mid-Year Outcomes"80012 rows, 3 columns (2 + key)- [employee_id]: key, join with "Employee Roster"- [perf_rating]: rank; calc [perf_rank]: 1..5; 1=negative, 2=neutral, 3=positive, 4=growth, 5=reorganize- [promo_decision]: binary, Y/N; Y="Ready this cycle";	- Recoded to [is_promo]; recoded to Y=1.		- 346 records of 8012 are "ready", or 4.32% of all records in "Mid-Year outcomes" sheet.	- Performance by promotion: this relationship reveals that only Rank 3 and higher were promoted, and also that the higher rank correlates with the lower promotion count, which means that there are fewer people who have had a higher performance, and vice versa.		- To conclude, the rank is used correctly.	- Additionally, % of promotions reveals a similar 8% promotion rate, which is actually slightly higher for the 4 and 5 performance scores. To conclude, the chances to be promoted, if one is at least exceeding expectations, are similar in proportion per the actual performance category.# Join data:Upon joining both employee and performance data sheets, some 2k records are missing performance information and thus were excluded.This also means, that the performance data is present for the first 8000 employees.Sample: only groups larger than 5% of 8000 are considered.4.
