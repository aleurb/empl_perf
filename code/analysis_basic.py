# To check for gender gaps in our multivariate dataset, we can conduct an analysis that includes summary statistics and visualizations.

# Here is a step-by-step recipe in `python`

# Import Necessary Libraries
# Load Your Dataset into a DataFrame.


# Check Basic Statistics:
    # Start by checking basic statistics to get an overview of the gender distribution and performance metrics.
    print(df['is_men'].value_counts())
    print(df.groupby('is_men')['perf_rank'].describe())




# basic Visualization
    # Plot gender distribution to see if there is any noticeable imbalance.
    sns.countplot(data=df, x='is_men')
    plt.title('Gender Distribution')
    plt.show()



# Analysis: performance rank by gender
    # Use box plots to compare the performance rank across genders.
    sns.boxplot(data=df, x='is_men', y='perf_rank')
    plt.title('Performance Rank by Gender')
    plt.show()


# Analyze: promotion rate by gender
    # Calculate the promotion rate for each gender.
    promotion_rate = df.groupby('is_men')['is_promo'].mean().reset_index()
    print(promotion_rate)

    sns.barplot(data=promotion_rate, x='is_men', y='is_promo')
    plt.title('Promotion Rate by Gender')
    plt.show()






# Detailed Analysis:
    # Use cross-tabulation to analyze the relationship between gender and other categorical variables like region, job group, and job level.

    pd.crosstab(df['is_men'], df['region'])
    pd.crosstab(df['is_men'], df['job_cat'])
    pd.crosstab(df['is_men'], df['job_rank'])



# Advanced Visualization:

    # Create more complex visualizations, such as comparing performance rank and promotion rates across multiple variables.

    sns.catplot(data=df, x='job_rank', y='perf_rank', hue='is_men', kind='box')
    plt.title('Performance Rank by Job Level and Gender')
    plt.show()

    sns.catplot(data=df, x='job_cat', y='is_promo', hue='is_men', kind='bar')
    plt.title('Promotion Rate by Job Group and Gender')
    plt.show()




# Data Insights:
    # After performing these steps, you should have a clearer picture of whether there are significant gender gaps in performance, promotions, and other job-related metrics.
    # You can further refine the analysis based on specific findings or delve deeper into areas showing disparities.
